In the world of online writing and content creation, it can be difficult to discern who to trust and who is simply "faking it till they make it."

I, like many, can admit to falling victim to this. As a person who decided after high school that I don't want to take the college route and forge my own path looked for ways to earn a living. This brought meto the rabbit hole of making money online.

As Nicolas Cole points out in his book, "The Art and Business of Online Writing," many people make money by teaching others how to make money online, perpetuating a cycle of false narratives and unrealistic expectations. Most of which I fell victim to.

While there is certainly valuable content to be found, it's important to approach the online world with a critical eye. Don't be swayed solely by metrics like followers or likes - these can be easily manipulated. Instead, we need to seek out diverse perspectives and sources that offer specific, valuable insights rather than broad, generic advice in this twisted culture.

## Fake It Till You Make It Culture

> “The idea of ‘fake it till you make it’ is dangerous. It’s better to be honest about what you don’t know and to be willing to learn from others.”

> “Authenticity is the key to building a successful brand. Faking it might get you some short-term success, but it won’t last.”

> “You can’t fake passion. If you’re not passionate about what you’re doing, it’s going to show.”

> “Faking it till you make it is just another way of saying ‘lying.’ It’s better to be honest about your abilities and work to improve them.” — Simen Sinek

Being authentic to who I am is one of my principles.

Too many don’t value it in a society where most human’s worth is equal to $$$, and that is why people will do whatever to obtain it. Even if it means lying to everyone, including themselves.

They turn life into a movie and they are the lead actor or actress, just to later find out that they can’t stop acting or their house of cards begins to fall.

A person who comes to mind is Robert Kiyosaki author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad”. Few people dug into his track record as an investor and entrepreneur but when you do you see he has failed all his business adventures. His book wasn’t just his claim to fame but his primary source of income. If want to learn more then I recommend you check out the [If Books Can Kill](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1sqPsRzo804XLboxT2uwmL?si=NMCi1jnvTcKajAM4BlUj4A) podcast to hear more.
I could be here all day talking about the YouTuber and writer online that make content about making money, but the only thing you need to hear is this.

**If they make money by “teaching” you how to, walk away.**

Very few people telling others online how to make money in Bitcoin, by investing, by writing, etc. have actually made money from it themselves and even more rarely made money from anything else.

It’s also worth noting that some creators may not be intentionally misleading their audience. Writing online and content creation is often a process of trial and error, and even the most successful people have had to refine their craft over time. Instead of faking it, you should adopt the mindset of pushing boundaries.

Anyone can be fake and act a certain way to give off a certain perception, it takes a special individual to recognize who they are and push to improve over time in front of others.

## Finding Your Gems

Now that we talked about who to avoid let’s find the people with value, our gems.

### Ignore metrics

Follower counts don’t matter… I feel like you glazed over so let’s say it again. FOLLOWER COUNTS DON’T MATTER.
Things like this don’t matter because vanity metrics like followers & likes can be inflated and not representative of that community.

### Check for Diverse Views 

No human being is simple-minded to the point they have one view on everything for an extended period. If they do then they are inauthentic.

### Look at Their Evolution Over Time

Go through their previous work and compare and contrast it to their current work to find growth.

### Where’s The Money Coming From

Had to come back to this even though I shouldn’t need to. You should do a little bit of research to see how someone earns the money to pay the bills, if you can’t find anything then move on.

Ultimately, the key is to approach online content and books with a discerning eye. Don’t blindly trust every creator or author you come across, but also don’t dismiss them outright. Take the time to evaluate their perspective and the value of their insights before deciding whether to incorporate them into your thinking. By doing so, you can separate the wheat from the chaff and find the truly valuable content that will help you grow and succeed.
